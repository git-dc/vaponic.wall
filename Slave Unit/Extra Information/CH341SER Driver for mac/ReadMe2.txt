Confirming that you should try out different cable! I tried 4 and only 2 were data cables.

Some things I learned when trying to connect my NodeMcu v3 Lolin to OSX:

Uninstall all existing drivers you tried - see section "Uninstalling From Macinstosh" from this link http://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html

upgrade your OSX to High Sierra if you haven't done so already

install the drivers posted by sleeman >> http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_MAC_ZIP.html

connect board via usb data cable to your machine

lists devices using terminal using command: ls /dev/tty.*
